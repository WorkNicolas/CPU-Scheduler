<p>

<b>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = 0 for the first process, and for subsequent processes, it is the sum of the burst times of all previous processes</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Burst time + Waiting time</li>
</ul>

<b>Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = Time process is ready to execute - Arrival time</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Burst time + Waiting time</li>
</ul>

<b>Priority Scheduling:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = Time spent in the ready queue waiting for CPU time</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Burst time + Waiting time</li>
</ul>

<b>Round-Robin Scheduling:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = Turnaround time - Burst time</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Time at which the process completes - Arrival time</li>
</ul>

<b>Multilevel Queue Scheduling:</b>

In Multilevel Queue Scheduling, processes are divided into different queues based on their characteristics (e.g., priority, memory requirements, etc.), and each queue is assigned a different scheduling algorithm. The waiting time and turnaround time formulas for Multilevel Queue Scheduling depend on the scheduling algorithms used for each queue.

Assuming each queue uses the FCFS scheduling algorithm, the formulas are:

<ul>
<li>Waiting time = 0 for the first process in each queue, and for subsequent processes in each queue, it is the sum of the burst times of all previous processes in that queue</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Burst time + Waiting time</li>
</ul>

For the case where each queue uses the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, the formulas are:

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = Turnaround time - Burst time</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Time at which the process completes - Arrival time</li>
</ul>

<b>Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) Scheduling:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Waiting time = Turnaround time - Burst time</li>

  <li>Turnaround time = Time at which the process completes - Arrival time</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">TASK üíΩ</h2> 
In a group (maximum of 4 members per group), create a program that will simliate and show the Gantt chart üìä of each CPU schedliing Algorithm.

<ul>
<li>
Choose your own programming language ‚úî
</li>
<li>
One program, one CPU scheduling Algorithm or one program, six CPU scheduling Algorithms (Use selection to choose what CPU scheduling Algorithm to show) ‚úî
</li>
<li>
Also, display/ print the waiting time and turnaround time for each process
</li>
<li>
Display Average Waiting time

<li>
Process may all arrive at time 0 or may arrive any time
</li>
<li>
Each process has its burst time. ‚úî
</li>
<li>
Priority might be observed in some cases
</li>
<li>
Time Slice might be observed in some cases
</li>
<li>
Pre-emptive or Non pre-emptive might be observed in some cases
</li>
<li>
Create a documentation (use your own format) then upload it as your answer
</li>
<li>
Documentation should contain:
